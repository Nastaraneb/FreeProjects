But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News.\n\n\n\n\nEver noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Abstractive Summarization using PEGASUS\n\nWe use the **PEGASUS** model to generate abstractive summaries,

The prize porker, known as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool. A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'At 4.50pm yesterday the service received a call to a pig stuck in a swimming pool. 'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex . The exhausted animal had to be winched to using an all-terrain crane but appeared no worse for wear after its tumble . 'The crew rescued the pig from the swimming pool using specialist animal rescue slide boards, strops and lines to haul the pig from the swimming pool.' But Pigwig wasn't the only animal who needed rescuing after taking an unexpected swim . Crews in West Sussex were called out to a swimming pool where this time a horse had fallen in. Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land. A fire brigade spokesman said that she appeared none the worse for her impromptu swim after stepping over the edge of the domestic pool.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
